# Project3 - Ohmyfood
Repository for my OpenClassrooms Project 3. Link: https://github.com/ifdzbenet/Project3.git

This Project is built around the Project 3 of the Web Developer path from OpenClassrooms. 

It's a website created with the objetive of giving the user a better experience when visiting the restaurants we offer in Ohmyfood.
The idea is to offer the custormers gastronomic restaurant menus, similar to an already existing service developed in New York.
It works in a way that we offer different restaurants located in Paris, where the customers can already select the dishes offered in the menu they wish to have at the place before arriving to the reservation. We also offer a favourite system, so the clients that decide to be a frequent customer can remember their favourite restaurant and past dishes selected from the menu.

The overall development of the page is mainly based on a mobile format for the layout, with a temporary desktop and tablet layout based on the mobile layout. The site is fully compatible with Chrome, Firefox and Safari. All the animations and transitions implemented are CSS coded, no JavaScript or library was used. 

It contains a loading spinner for all pages, as well as a contact form page that pops-up when clicking in the "Contact" category in the Footer section.

The project was initally developed using the CSS language, which was eventually migrated into SCSS as it was requested from the company. It is very important to note that the different pages this website contains are linked to the CSS document compiled from the SCSS document, so in order to be able to experience the website as it was intended, all files should be downloaded and set up. 

In this first version, the website contains 6 pages: index, contact form, and 4 pages for each of the restaurant's menus we offer. All of them are linked to each other, so in the case of running it, by opening the index document, it should be enough to reach all 6 pages from the different maps distributed in the website. It's not recommended to open all the documents as it will take away from the experience of finding them through the initial page.
